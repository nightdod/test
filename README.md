# Getting Started
First of all Clone this Project or Download it if you wanna run it on localhost/your own computer

# Installation
After Downloading the Project, Go in Terminal/Console (If you are on local computer than Enter the Directory where the project is unzipped) and type `npm install` <br>

# Setting Up
After Installing all the node modules and packages you have to setup config.js. For doing it go to config.js and you will have something like this - <br>
```
module.exports = {
  mongourl : "", // MongoDB Url 
  callback: "", // The Callback for discord auth e.g - https://yourwebsite.com/callback
  botid: "", // Your Official botID
  botsecret: "" // Your Official Bot Client Secret
  bottoken: "" // Your Official Bot Token
}
```
So in Mongourl Give your Mongodb Url. <br> <br>
In Callback You have to give https://yourwebsite.com/callback and replace yourwebsite.com with your domain (If you are on Local Computer than replace it with localhost:8000). After Doing that Go in Your Discord Developers Portal And in That Portal Choose your Official bot and in that bot page select Oauth2 and in Redirects Click on `add another redirect` Than in the Text Area give the link which you also entered in the config.js callback. Just paste it in that text area and than save. <br>
<br>
In Bot ID Give your Official bot's client ID from the Discord Developers Portal of that bot. <br> <br>
In Bot Secret Give your Official bot's Client Secret from the Discord Developers Portal of that bot. You can find it in Oauth2 Section. <br> <br>
And the Last Give your Official bot's Token from the Discord Developers Portal of that bot. You can find it in Bot Section. <br>
